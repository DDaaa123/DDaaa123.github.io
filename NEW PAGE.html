<h1>HISTORY OF ACTING.</h1>
​<span style='font-size:100px;'>&#128512;</span>

Acting can give people the opportunity to become someone else and the ability to become people they could never be otherwise.
They get to explore different realms, create characters, entertain others, make the audience laugh or feel a different emotion that perhaps they had never felt before. Performance can test people’s courage and allow them to receive the attention they crave. Acting often makes people feel free. This paper will tell you how acting came to be to this day. 

Acting originated in Greece between 550-220BC. The first actor was Thespis. He was born in the ancient city lcarius and had a passion for poetry. He is known as the first person to act on stage. Some people refer to him as the “inventor of tragedy.” The types of plays he did were mostly tragedy, religious, and comedy. He would host festivals where he performed in open air theaters in honor of the god Dionysus, son of Zeus, was known as the god of fruitfulness, vegetation and wine. 

In 240 BC-476 AD, the government of Rome promoted performance art and public entertainment. To show the Romans that Caesar cared, the government would offer free entertainment throughout both the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. The Roman theater borrowed from the Greek precedent. The entertainment included chariot racing, gladiatorial combat and stage acting. 

In 401-500AD, the medieval theater changed the face of acting. How they would entertain people is that they would perform in small groups around Europe; some included acrobats and performed tumbling, gymnastics, and others were mimes who acted out stories with just body movements. During the Middle Ages new styles of performance developed, in which they sang and danced for royalty in France. 

The great Shakespeare entered the stage in 1564. Shakespeare became well known in London in 1592. During that time he started to write some of his earliest plays, which included Henry VI, part 1 through 3, the Two Gentlemen of Verona and Titus Andronicus. Scholars have not quite figured out which one was written first. Shakespeare also published poems, some were long. “Venus” and “Adonis” were published in 1593 and the poem "The Rape of Lucrece" was published in 1594. These two of Shakespeare's poems were both dedicated to Henry Wriothesley, Earl of Southampton, who had become Shakespeare's patron. Only men and boys acted in the plays. The type of plays they performed were comedies, romances, historical scenes and tragedy. These were performed either in an outdoor play house, indoor theater or a royal palace. Shakespeare’s company built the Globe Theatre in London in 1599, where the audience first saw Shakespeare plays. Actors used vivid words. During one of their performances in 1613, the roof caught on fire and burned to the floor. The second Globe was quickly rebuilt, opening in 1614. 

In the early 16th century, the French neoclassicism style of activity took hold when actors performed moralities, miracle plays, farces and sorties. The thing that was most important was an amateur guild called Confrère de la Passion that held a monopoly on acting in Paris. Soon they decided to make their own theater in 1548, the most beautiful stage and auditorium. It was a narrow room with the stage filling one end, and it contained a pit for the spectators. There were galleries around both walls and the stage and auditorium were lit up with candles. But not long after the theater opened, the Confrère was banished to perform religious plays because churchmen accused Confère of adding apocryphal. They were soon overpowered by the Renaissance influence and dramatists began looking to Classical antiquity for inspiration. In the 17th century actors began to perform great drama. The plays were still performed in Paris, mostly as tragicomedies, which were written by Classical scholars as imitations. After this, the Valleran-Lecomte took over the Hotel de Bourgogne at the end of the 17th century; there they began to perform more medieval style plays, but it was not given any realism as actors would say their lines simply standing in front of the stage then would return to allow the next actor to speak. This concludes the French neoclassicism.

In the 18th century sentimental theater came to be. This is a type of acting where the audience was moved from tears to laughter. Scholars argue that the person who wrote the first sentimental comedy play was Gollby Cibber, an actor, manager and poet laureate. He gave himself a role in a a play he wrote called “Love's Last Shift.". This style of acting began in England in 1690 and continued into the 1730s. Sentimental acting also was very over acted; just like the French, they used a lot of emotions.  

Coming up to the 19th century, melodrama came into being. This was influenced by the French in 1840.  Plays were performed in theaters like Surrey and Coburg in South London. In the word “melodrama” the “melo” is Latin for music drama because melodrama contains lots of music. This was one of the first types of acting to use live music. As well as the sentimental theater, this type of theater uses many emotions. When characters' signature music was played just as an actor would say their lines, the music would match the scene or emotion. It also contains explosions, drownings and earthquakes and became the most popular type of theater at that time. Historically this type of theater was most popular in Europe, Australia and North America and is still a type of theater acting seen to this day.  

While the French were over-acting, a realism and naturalism style was developing in Eastern Europe. Characters began to talk more naturally rather than use either verse or poetry style. In Russia there was a playwright named Aleksey Pisemsky; with Leo Tolstoy they both began to write a new tradition of theater: dialogue of realism. 

The first film was the Roundhay garden scene, which is only around 2.11 seconds. Louis de Le Prince was a French inventor who produced the film. This film contained people just simply walking around a garden in Oak Wood Grange in Roundhay. Presented on October 14, 1888, Le Prince's mother-in-law was the first known person to ever appear in a film. Louis’s son Adolph Le Prince and Louis's father-in-law were also in the film. Le Prince was never able to perform. He planned a demonstration of his invention and film in the U.S, but he vanished off a train on September 16, 1890. His body and luggage were never found. Over a century later police found a photograph of a drowning man who might be Le Prince. Nonetheless the industry of film activity had begun. 

In 1887, Hollywood was laid out by Harvey Wilcox and was built that same year and became the capital of film. Hollywood is located in California. It’s Golden Age was between the 1920s and 60s. This is when Hollywood ruled, meaning the big five studios, which are MGM, Paramount Pictures, RKO, 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros, controlled the film Industry. These companies created stars such as Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland. Hollywood controlled them in many ways because of their strict rules. Here are some of the rules celebrities had to follow: Actors Should Never Judge Their Own Performances, Don't Talk To Method Actors and Don't Ask For Autographs. Hollywood’s Golden Age came to an end because of two main reasons: antitrust actions and the invention of television.

Silent films arrived in the late 1800’s. Silent film suits its name as there were no sound in early films. Live music, like piano, or organs were played live during the films to provide drama. Scene were simple; there would be only one climactic movement. They would be performed in small theaters in small towns. Actors were very dramatic because they did not have the things we have today. 

On October 6, 1927, a movie called The Jazz Singer introduced sound in a film. Jolson spoke sixty words in one scene and 294 in another scene. Inventors had discovered how to place audio tracks right onto the film. The rest of the play was either silent or there were songs; the film was presented in Seattle. Films with audio were slow but soon advanced in the 1920s. These kinds of movies are called talkies. Talkies were films with music running on the filmstrip itself, sometimes accompanied by a live orchestra. There were usually not a lot of spoken words and the films were around 86 minutes long. Actors could now be seen and heard on film! 

In 1965, Ray Dolby founded Dolby Laboratories. Dolby sound is the music you hear to create a dramatic scene, like in a scary movie. It created the experience of many sounds from a distance or location. Movies and television contained only one channel of sound up to that point. The producers had a variety of audio tracks. The first movie to ever have Dolby Sound was A Clockwork Orange, which was made in 1971.

CGI started in the 1950s when mechanical computers were reproduced to show animation patterns which were then incorporated into a film.  The first film to use CGI Computer-Generated-Imagery was Westworld. In 1972, Edwin Catmull and Fred Park were the first to create a short animation film. The film was called ''A Computer Animated Hand,'' which contained 3D film. This feat was achieved when Edwin drew 350 triangles and polygons in ink on his hand and then digitized and laboriously animated the data in a 3D animation program that Catmull actually wrote. Now actors could act with objects or images that were not even on the film set or real. 

Hollywood helped CGI advance in 1973. Westworld took a big role in the first 2D CGI scene showing “gunslinger’’ visionary, introducing how robots can see. Sequels were very much inspired by the success. This transported the audience deeper into the story experience. 

In the 1900’s, cinema theaters began to be built. The first cinema was built on June 9, 1905.  Today there are 10,000 cinemas around the United States. This industry supports cinema and film actors all over the world. 

Acting has evolved so much throughout the centuries and is still evolving today.  It’s changed its purpose, presentation and access. Initially only the aristocracy was familiar with the theater arts, but nowadays anyone can be in the audience or on the stage. The transition from theater to films and television has taken acting to a whole new level, including the techniques actors and their directors use. Even though acting has changed so much, why people still act is perhaps for the same reason.
